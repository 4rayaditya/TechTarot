Edits made :- 

1) Added "Tech Tarrot" text in the middle of the page
    & added directions at the bottom of the page to click anywhere to go ahead with the tarot reading.
- intended to add a logo-cum text png, but I did not like the way it turned out so replaced it with simple clear text. 


2) Added glow to the edges of the window

3) Added a rotating yellow sphere at the botton of the page
- but its hardly noticeable because of the colors which currenty do not give that element enough dimension

4) Added a section to input user's name and birthday, to make the site more interactive.
- added png for the design of the form
- made it so the cards would not be interactable untill the form has been filled

5) Modified the card- back design and changed its color to blue to fit with the color theme of the webpage

6) added randomisation to the cards, so a different card is picked everytime

7) changed the result layout, to include the cards which were picked with their information in a uniform manner.

8) made sure the same card is not picked more than once

* added hover shine animation to the result cards
* various other minor design changes and modifications
